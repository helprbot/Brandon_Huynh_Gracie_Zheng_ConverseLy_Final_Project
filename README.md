# ConverseLy

ConverseLy is a SwiftUI-based program intended to help travellers get a grasp on a foreign language before they interact with the locals. The pre-developed conversations within the ConverseLy database are common interactions that travellers may have with the locals -- from asking for directions, to ordering coffee, to taking someone's picture. The reason why ConverseLy should be used over other language-learning apps and programs is because it focuses on practical, scenario-focused vocabulary so that users can expidite their language-learning process without the hassle of needing to understand the entire language; ConverseLy users can simply open the app, select the conversation they need to have, and work through the program so they can interact with the locals of the country they are visiting.
